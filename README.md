# Ricing Arch Linux - Configuration Files

This repository contains the configuration files as well as the installation
process to most of my important Arch Linux configurations. My personal
configurations of most programs are stored in here and I've tried to compile
them and make them as simple as possible to install. These configuration files
are the result of scavenging through various peoples' GitHub pages and
selecting the bits of their configurations that I liked. Some of things I
created myself.
